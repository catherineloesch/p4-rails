He is an active dog and loves walking for hours. Kaiser is toilet trained and very obedient, especially when called. He loves to play and is very gentle with other dogs, especially smaller dogs and puppies. Kaiser dislikes being left alone, although he can manage small periods of separation.")

He loves walks, playing fetch in the park, playing with his cat brother Boo and doing tricks for treats. We travel every couple of months so it would be fantastic to find someone that loves dogs and builds a bond with him, so they can care for our baby while we are away.")

I'm Art and I have a 2 year-oldPembroke Welsh Corgi called Pabu. Pabu is a very friendly 1 year old corgi. He loves to play with a ball and eat things he shouldn’t! He loves to say hi to all other dogs, he prefers dogs his own size and especially other corgis! He is fairly obedient however we would ask dog walks to keep him on the lead. Probably his only slightly bad habit is that he doesn’t like to leave the park.Keen to find people who wouldn’t mind pabu hanging out at theirs one day a week whilst we’re at work roughly 9-6pm. He would require one big walk in that time and a couple of pee breaks. Otherwise he will probably sleep or pester you to play! Let me know if you live close by!")

Astra is 5 months old and Aries is 13 years old. Astra is extremely affectionate and loves giving kisses. She has lots of energy, loves playing with her dogs, cuddling up to humans and chasing dogs in the park. Aries as you can imagine has less energy than Astra, he’s a calm and laid back boy who loves being outside, running after a ball, meeting other dogs or just sniffing the grass. We’re looking for some doggie lovers who can spend some time with them and help get some of that puppy energy out with some additional walks.")
